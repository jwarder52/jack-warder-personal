Personal repository to show various projects I have created over the years.

Inside the RSA_Java folder is my implementation of the RSA encryption algoritghm using BigInteger.
Under the readme file in that folder are example tests for my algorithm.

Inside the AI branch is my attempt at decoding RSA with a genetic algorithm for small primes.
