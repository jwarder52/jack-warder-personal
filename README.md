# jack-warder-personal
Personal repository to show various projects I have created over the years.

Inside the RSA_Java folder is my implementation of the RSA encryption algoritghm using BigInteger.
Under the readme file in that folder are example tests for my algorithm.

Inside the AI_Genetic_RSA folder is my attempt at decoding RSA with a genetic algorithm for small primes.
Included in the readme file are values to test.
I have also included a pdf of my partner and I's findings.

Inside the Figma_Design folder is my team and I's design for our client HortiMundi's app.
Both a pdf of all the pages and a .fig file containing the in-figma documentation and connections are included.

Inside the Computer_Graphics folder is my partner and I's solar system we built using WebGL inside Apache Netbeans.
Both the netbeans project is inside along with a showcase folder with screenshots of it running locally.
